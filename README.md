## Hello There
Im Sahil Singh, a 16 year old who is currently going to grade 11. I am new to the tech community and am willing to learn as much as I can about it. When I grow up I would like to try engineering. Dont know what kind considering there are many types but as I evolve as a person I bet I will find the best type of engineering for me.


## What I am Working On
- I am currently working on making a 10 sided dice and A maze game in makecodearcade. Would love input on how to imrpove both projects when I do upload them on my portfolio.
## What I'm Learning
- I'm currently learning about the many sectors of the tech industry via a High School Tech Program which had started July 8th and will end on August 16th.
## What I would like help in
- I would love some help with my maze game where I try to mkae a specific block kill an enemy when touched and not the player, However it should also only destroy the enemy who touched the block rather then all of the enemy sprites when one enemy touches the tile
## What you can ask me
- You can ask me to rate music if you like, I sort of have a knak with numbers and reviewing things used a number based system
## Pronouns
- I go by he/him prononuns
